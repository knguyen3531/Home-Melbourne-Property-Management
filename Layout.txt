Can you please help me create a layout of files for codes to meet with this project requirement? I might work with you more to build them, but the first steps properly the easiest for me is to build a layout: # 24 Final Project: MERN Stack Single-Page Application

Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. Your portfolio showcases high-quality deployed examples of your work, and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements

Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### MY TOPIC

Website Overview:
We propose developing a comprehensive property management website for Home Melbourne that will streamline our operations and enhance our services. This website will serve as a centralized platform for managing properties, tenants, and billing processes.

Key Features:

Property Management Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard that provides an overview of all managed properties, their status, and key information.

Tenant Management: An integrated tenant database with tenant profiles, lease agreements, contact information, and lease history.

Rent Tracking: Track and manage rental payments, generate automated rent invoices, and send payment reminders to tenants.

Maintenance Requests: Tenants can submit maintenance requests through the website, and property managers can efficiently track, assign, and update the status of these requests.

Document Management: Store and manage essential documents such as lease agreements, property contracts, and tenant documentation securely on the platform.

Billing Portal: Allow property owners and tenants to access billing statements, financial reports, and transaction history conveniently.

Property Listings: List available properties for lease with detailed descriptions, photos, and pricing, attracting potential tenants.

Communication Tools: Incorporate messaging or notification systems for property managers to communicate with tenants and property owners seamlessly.

Account Access Control: Implement role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized users can view or edit sensitive information.

Online Payment Integration: Enable online rent payments, security deposits, and fees, making transactions convenient and secure.

Calendar and Reminders: Integrated calendar for property inspections, lease renewals, and other important dates with automated reminders.

Benefits:

By developing this property management website, Home Melbourne will enhance its operational efficiency, improve tenant and owner satisfaction, and streamline financial management. The platform will provide real-time access to property data, automate routine tasks, reduce paperwork, and facilitate transparent communication.

We believe that this website will be an invaluable tool for Home Melbourne, making property management smoother and more efficient while enhancing the overall customer experience.

### CSS Styling


Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

* Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

* Try using a component library, such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

* Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose&mdash;it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

### Payment Platform

Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

### Bonus

Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:

* Uses a web manifest

* Uses a service worker for offline functionality

* Is installable

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following:

* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the [Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a project submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This project is graded based on the following criteria:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 25%

* Satisfies the following code requirements:

  * Application uses React for the front end.

  * Application has a GraphQL API with a Node.js and Express.js server, and uses queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

  * Application uses MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database and protects sensitive API key information on the server.

  * Application includes user authentication using JWT.

### Concept 10%

* Application should be a unique and novel idea.

* Your group should clearly and concisely articulate your project idea.

### Deployment: 20%

* Application deployed at live URL on Heroku and loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

### Repository Quality: 10%

* Uses a web manifest

* Uses a service worker for offline functionality

* Is installable

## How to Submit Your MERN Stack Single-Page Application

**Each member of your group** is required to submit the following for review:
